        <p>This is just beautiful. The art and design are engaging and the site layout is engaging enough to be interesting, but not so different that I canâ€™t get through it. The various artists are listed in a unique way at the beginning and sets the tone for the rest of the site. I do wish that in the artists sections I could scroll up and down through some of the continuous reels though.

        <p>This is a fun portfolio site with a High Design estetic complimented by upbeat repeating music and some really fun unexpected quirky bits.

        <p>First love these cute little eyeballs up in the tabs!This is a really fun engaging site. Things wharp, wiggle, turn and twist, drop-down, gate close and open. You can really tell that they are accustomed to paying attention to the details. Every little piece shimmies or shakes, videos start and stop by just hovering, and the video frames wharp as you scroll through the catalog. I went back to the three sections several times because all the movement makes it feel new every time.
